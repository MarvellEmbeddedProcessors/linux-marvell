OpenSSL
===========
 In order to explore the CESA unit through the OpenSSL, you have to use the
 OpenSSL OCF cryptodev engine.
 By default the cryptodev engine will use the CESA
 accelerator.

 o In case missing, create a crypto device: mknod /dev/crypto c 10 70
 o Download latest openssl source package from http://www.openssl.org, then untar+unzip it.
 o In case missing, copy from kernel crypto/ocf/cryptodev.h to file-system path: /usr/include/crypto .
 o Run: ./config -DHAVE_CRYPTODEV no-shared
 o and compile ...('make' and 'make install')

 you can run a speed test to make sure everything is working:
	openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed
 Modify /dev/crypto to /dev/crypto_tmp so that the speed test will use
 now software encryption.
 Run again:
        openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed
 Compare results.
