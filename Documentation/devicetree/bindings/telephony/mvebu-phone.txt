* mvebu (Armada 38x/XP/80x0) TDM telephony controller

Required properties:

- compatible:
  "marvell,armada-380-tdm" for Armada 38x platforms
  "marvell,armada-xp-tdm" for Armada AXP platforms
  "marvell,armada-a8k-tdm" for Armada 80x0 platforms

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region (named "tdm_regs").
  With "marvell,armada-380-tdm" two other regions are required:
  first of those is dedicated for Audio PLL Configuration registers
  (named "pll_regs") and the second one ("dco_div") - for register
  where DCO post-divider for PLL output is set.

- interrupts - TDM controller interrupt

- clocks: phandle for internal gate clock

- clock-names: name associated to the clocks: "gateclk"

Optional properties:

- pclk-freq-mhz: internal pclk frequency. If not set, the driver uses
  default value of 8 MHz

- use-pclk-external: chooses SLIC as an external pclk source

- spi-mode: set <0> for direct connection and <1> for daisy-chain mode.
  If not set, by default direct mode is used. This property is valid
  only for TDM2C devices, for TDMMC it will be ignored.

Example:

tdm@b0000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-380-tdm";
	reg = <0xb0000 0x5000>, <0x18400 0xc>, <0x18730 0x4>;
	reg-names = "tdm_regs", "pll_regs", "dco_div";
	interrupts = <0 27 0x4>;
	clocks = <&gateclk 25>;
	clock-names = "gateclk";
	pclk-freq-mhz = <8>;
};

In case an external SLIC is used, there is a need of instantiating it as
a slave SPI device under one of SPI busses (please refer to:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt)

Required properties:

- compatible: "mv_slic" for Armada 38x platforms

- reg: SLIC slave spi device interface chip select number

- spi-max-frequency: SLIC slave spi device interface max clock
  frequency

Zarlink/Silabs SLIC devices require also following properties:

- spi-1byte-cs - switch CS every single byte transferred

- spi-cpol - active-low clk

- spi-cpha - accept data on clk trailing edge

Optional property:

- slic-id - logical ID of SPI device from range 0 - 31. If not used,
  the driver will set it to '0'. If more than one SLIC device is
  used, this property is obligatory for proper operation.

spi1: spi@10680 {
	pinctrl-0 = <&spi1_pins>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	status = "okay";

	slic@0 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "mv_slic";
		reg = <0>; /* Chip select 0 */
		spi-max-frequency = <3000000>;
		spi-1byte-cs;
		spi-cpol;
		spi-cpha;
		slic-id = <1>;
	};
};
