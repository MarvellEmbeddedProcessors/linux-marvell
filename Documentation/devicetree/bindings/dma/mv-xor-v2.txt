* Marvell XOR v2 engines

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,mv-xor-v2"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length (two sets)
    the first set is the DMA registers
    the second set is the global registers
- dma-bus-width: DMA address bus width
- msi-parent: Phandle to the MSI-capable interrupt controller used for
  interrupts.
- clocks: One ore more clock gating clocks to be used to enable DMA engine
  unit in the SoC.

Example:

	xor0@400000 {
		compatible = "marvell,mv-xor-v2";
		reg = <0x400000 0x1000>,
		      <0x410000 0x1000>;
		msi-parent = <&gic_odmi>;
		clocks = <&gateclk 14>;
		dma-coherent;
		dma-width = <40>;
	};
