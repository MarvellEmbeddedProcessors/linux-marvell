Kernel Build Instructions
=========================

ARMv8 Platforms
---------------

Follow the following sequence to build ARMv8 platforms::

	> export CROSS_COMPILE=<path/to/cross/compiler/>
	  (Path to gcc compiler, without the gcc suffix. e.g. CROSS_COMPILE=/my_compilers/gcc-5.2/bin/aarch64-marvell-linux-gnu-)
	> export ARCH=arm64
	> make mvebu_v8_lsp_defconfig
	> make - for build kernel image and device tree images.

- Linux image is under: 'arch/arm64/boot/Image'.
- Device tree images are generated under: 'arch/arm64/boot/dts/marvell'.


ARMv7 Platforms
---------------

Follow the following sequence to build ARMv7 platforms::

	> export CROSS_COMPILE=<path/to/cross/compiler/>
	  (Path to gcc compiler, without the gcc suffix. e.g. CROSS_COMPILE=/my_compilers/gcc-5.2/bin/aarch64-marvell-linux-gnu-)
	> export ARCH=arm
	> make mvebu_v7_lsp_defconfig
	> make - for build kernel image and device tree images.
	> make zImage - for build kernel image


- Linux image is under: 'arch/arm/boot/zImage'.
- Device tree images are generated under: 'arch/arm/boot/dts'.
