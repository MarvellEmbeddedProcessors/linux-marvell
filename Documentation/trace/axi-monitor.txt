Introduction
------------

The AXI monitor (AXIM) is a HW bus monitor that enables detecting specific
transactions on the AXI bus and use them for trace and debug purposes.
It is very useful for debugging DMA accesses from HW devices but it can
also be used to analyze the load on the DRAM interface or other system buses.

The AXIM uses up to 12 comparators, called channels, to detect bus events.
An events occur when a transaction matching the channel's filter is detected.
A Channel event can have several outcomes. It can merely increment the channel's
event counter, it can trigger an STM trace, cross trigger a CTI block, or
increment profiling counters which can measure latency or transaction sizes.
The profiling counters can also be independently traced to the STM.

An AXIM monitors a single direction bus, meaning a read channel or write channel.
A typical AXIM connection may look like this.

					     -------

AXI channel (rd/wr)	|      |    |	     |     |

The AXI monitor has several revisions with different feature set:

Rev 1:
   * Event detection and filtering
   * Cross triggering CTI on event
Rev 2
   * Profiling of transaction variables
   * Tracing detected events and profiling counters

How to use
----------

Debug mode
----------
To detect specific transactions the AXIM channel filters must be configured
The channel filters are set by specific sysfs file in the AXIM folder
Then the entire monitor needs to be enabled.
Finally the event counters can be read by another sysfs file

For example to detect transaction between physical address 0x0 and 0x1000

    /* Set the required channel */
    root:/# echo 0x0 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/curr_chan

    /* Set the filters */
    root:/# echo 0x0 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/channel/addr_start
    root:/# echo 0x1000 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/channel/addr_end

    /* enable the channel and the monitor*/
    root:/# echo 0x1 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/channel/enable
    root:/# echo 0x1 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/channel/mon_enable

    /* read the channel counter */
    root:/# cat sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/channel/counter
    /* or read all channel counter */
    root:/# cat sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0840000.axim/counters

Another example is detecting all non secure shareable device accesses:

    /* Set the required channel */
    root:/# echo 0x1 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/curr_chan

    /* Set the filters */
    root:/# echo 0x2 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/domain
    root:/# echo 0x3 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/domain_mask
    root:/# echo 0x2 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/prot
    root:/# echo 0x2 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/prot_mask

    /* enable the channel and the monitor*/
    root:/# echo 0x1 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/enable
    root:/# echo 0x1 > sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/mon_enable

    /* read the channel counter */
    root:/# cat sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/channel/counter
    /* or read all channel counter */
    root:/# cat sys/bus/coresight/devices/f0850000.axim/counters

The specific sysfs files and their functions are documented under:
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-coresight-devices-axim

NOTE:
CPU or device accesses may not map the same to AXI bus transactions.
For example when a CPU accesses a non 64byte aligned address (e.g 0x10), the L2 may
issue a cache line prefetch to the aligned address (0x0). Therefore it is advised
to use addresses which are 64 byte aligned. Also some transaction may be served by
caches which are not visible to specific AXI monitor in use. Therefore it is important
to understand the transaction characteristics for correct filtering.
