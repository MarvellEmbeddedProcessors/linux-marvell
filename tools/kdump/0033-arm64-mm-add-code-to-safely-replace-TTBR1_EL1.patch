Subject: [PATCH 033/123] arm64: mm: add code to safely replace TTBR1_EL1

If page tables are modified without suitable TLB maintenance, the ARM
architecture permits multiple TLB entries to be allocated for the same
VA. When this occurs, it is permitted that TLB conflict aborts are
raised in response to synchronous data/instruction accesses, and/or and
amalgamation of the TLB entries may be used as a result of a TLB lookup.

The presence of conflicting TLB entries may result in a variety of
behaviours detrimental to the system (e.g. erroneous physical addresses
may be used by I-cache fetches and/or page table walks). Some of these
cases may result in unexpected changes of hardware state, and/or result
in the (asynchronous) delivery of SError.

To avoid these issues, we must avoid situations where conflicting
entries may be allocated into TLBs. For user and module mappings we can
follow a strict break-before-make approach, but this cannot work for
modifications to the swapper page tables that cover the kernel text and
data.

Instead, this patch adds code which is intended to be executed from the
idmap, which can safely unmap the swapper page tables as it only
requires the idmap to be active. This enables us to uninstall the active
TTBR1_EL1 entry, invalidate TLBs, then install a new TTBR1_EL1 entry
without potentially unmapping code or data required for the sequence.
This avoids the risk of conflict, but requires that updates are staged
in a copy of the swapper page tables prior to being installed.
